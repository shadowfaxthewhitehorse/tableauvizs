# tableauvizs

This repo has my visualizations, including those from Tableau.

All the files in this folder pertain to visualizations, except the few files with the prefix C0_CHINA*. 

The files with the prefix CO_CHINA* form a set of photographs comprising:

- a first set of photos of shops in China, done as part of visualization work for a firm.
- a second set of other photographs taken in China, also done as part of visualization work for a firm.

If you need the code for Bokeh and/or access to the Tableau workbooks, please contact me directly.
