# tableauvizs

This repo has my visualizations, including those from Tableau.

All the files in this folder pertain to visualizations, except the few files with the prefix C0_CHINA*. 

The files with the prefix CO_CHINA* form a set of photographs comprising:

- a first set of photos of shops in China, done as part of visualization work for a firm.
- a second set of other photographs taken in China, also done as part of visualization work for a firm.

If you need the code for Bokeh and/or access to the Tableau workbooks, please contact me directly. 

NOTES:

1. D0, D1, D2: these files comprise the output of Bokeh code for the visualization of stock data. Stock prices of the prices of the stock of Microsoft, IBM, et cetera, are visualized.

2. E0, E1: these files comprise the output of Bokeh code for the visualization of stock price data. Stock prices of selected stocks are compared against each other.
