# tableauvizs

This repo has my visualizations, including those from Tableau.

All the files in this folder pertain to visualizations, except the few files with the prefix C0_CHINA*. 

The files with the prefix CO_CHINA* form a set of photographs comprising:

- a first set of photos of shops in China, done as part of visualization work for a firm.
- a second set of other photographs taken in China, also done as part of visualization work for a firm.

If you need the code for Bokeh and/or access to the Tableau workbooks, please contact me directly. These files were generated as part of larger projects involving
significant modeling. For example, the stock visualizations were generated as part of a project done for the lab associated with a leading newspaper in India 
(just like Walmart Inc. has Walmart Labs, this newspaper also has a lab associated with it.) Modeling work included time-series modeling of stock data to 
generate predictions. Other modelling work included building a Recommendation Engine for generating recommendations for movies.

NOTES:
[==+==]
1. E series (that is, files with the prefix E0, E1, et cetera): these files comprise the output of Bokeh code for the visualization of stock price data. Stock prices 
of selected stocks are compared against each other. Software used: Bokeh, Google Colab.

2. A1 series (that is, files with the prefix A1): a visualization of Indian Parliamentary Election results. Software used: Bokeh, Google Colab, IDLE.

3. 9 series (that is, files with the prefix 9): a visualization of trigonometric curves. Software used: Bokeh, Python.

4. A2 series: a visualization of trigonometric curves. Software used: Bokeh, Google Colab.

5. A3 series: a visualization of bar plots for an audio transcription project. Software used: Bokeh.

6. 3 series: a visualization overlaid on map data. Software used: Bokeh, Python. The type of map can be changed based on a parameter specified in a parameter file. 
Generally speaking, both political maps and terrain maps can be generated.

7. 6 series: a visualization generated for an A.I. project for generating poetry using Artificial Intelligence. The project called Charlotte resulted in two published books of poetry. A Reddit AskMeAnything was done for the first book. A new Theory of History was presented in the second book. Very pleased to say that academics involving eminent economists such as Tyler Cowen have actually read said work.
