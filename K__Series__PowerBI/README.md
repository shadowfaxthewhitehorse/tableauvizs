This folder has some of the visualizations pertaining to an Australian dataset. 

Various interesting aspects of the nation of Australia were highlighted in the project.

In this visualization from the project, a map of Australia was created with a bubble centered on each state. The size of the bubble was proportional to the population density of each state.

The (political) boundaries of each state are also indicated. Nations surrounding Australia and their capitals are also shown.
