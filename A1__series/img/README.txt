This file is the README file for the images created for the India Independence Day Data Visualization project.

The photos taken are of the Vidhana Soudha in Bangalore, India.

Note: the attractiveness of the lighting could have been improved by choosing a different color arrangement. This simply points to the importance of good 
visual design.
